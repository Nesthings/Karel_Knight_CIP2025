Princess Ada Lovelace has been kidnapped by the Bug Empire! Embark on a perilous journey across a world of tiles and challenges, where you'll be surrounded by tricky bugs and programming quizzes. Each step brings you closer to rescuing the princessâ€¦ and mastering key programming concepts along the way!

This is the final project for Stanford University Code In Place 2025.

Built completely in Python using TKinter

Functionalities:

## GO button:
Rolls 2 dices of 6 faces each, this is the way you move through the board.

## Friend compiler:
Green orb that will help you through your journey by moving you 3 extra spaces forward when you encounter it.

## Betrayer Bug:
Red ord that will make you move back 3 places when you fall in it.

## Enemy:
Your most powerful weapon against this enemy is the knowledge! The enemy will throw you a random programming question, you will have to answer correctly,
you will defeat it if you do, if you don't you will lose a hearth (You will start with 10)

Sorry if the function and names in the code are in spanish and english, my native language is spanish but when I program I mostly think in english..

Try, modify, improve or do whatever you want with the game.

THANKS CIP 2025!
